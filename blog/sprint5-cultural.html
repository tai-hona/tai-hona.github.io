      <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <h2>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h2>
          <p>
              I believed that going into foundations I limited myself at how well I would learn and how capable I would be able to understand programming
              because I never really thought of myself as a computer person. I could never picture myself in a career path I.T related. But foundations has taught me that
              everyone has the ability to get better at anything they set their mind to, If they believe it themselves. I'm now confident in being able to know how
              my learning is going to go on some days based on how I feel waking up, what I ate for breakfast, how many times I've been on my phone all because im more aware
              of myself in the present. In terms of ego I was used to being the one helping others more than getting help and I didn't like to ask for help. But during foundations
              its changed the way I thought of asking for help. I used to think that I was dumb when I asked for help, now I know that its dumb for not asking. The last thing
              I noticed about myself during foundations is how easily frustrated I can get at very little unimportant things. I need to calm down and to remember that getting things wrong
               isn't a step back but a step towards progress and that this all part of the process.
          </p>

        <h2>The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h2>  
          <p>
            
          </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning</h2>  
          <p>
              The thing that most surprised me about foundations is the enormous emphasis on non-technical skills that they really want us to learn. They understand
              that to get a job and to get along with others, these skills are essential because employers are not just judging your technical capabilities, 
              but also your self-awareness, what kind of person you are, could you be a problem in a team setting and if you are flexible enough to learn while working.
              Before starting foundations I never really thought of anything other than learning technical skills But after, I now understand that things like mindfulness, 
              emotional intelligence and having a growth mindset is just as important as being proficient in technical skills.
          </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2> 
          <p>
              Coming into foundations with literally no knowledge about programming, I definitely had many challenges to overcome when learning something which was foreign to myself.
              But the biggest challenge that I personally had to deal during foundations was getting back into the whole studying groove. Even during school I was never good at studying.
              I wasn't easy either because I was working for so long that changing certain habits was especially hard. Foundations is unlike anything I'm used to but is something I'm trying to
              improve as I go along.
          </p> 
        <h2>Why do I think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course</h2>  
          <p>
              Well it isn't possible to learn absolutely everything in 15 weeks because it is really hard to learn because programming is ever evolving, it would take years.
              I believe the aim of bootcamp is that strip away everything that isn't neccesary, and teach us everything that makes us able to become programmers with the ability
              to learn more efficiently and quicker too. The non-technical skills will help us be able to better understand who work with because being able to work in a team is a good
              quality to have. It also helps us as programmers understand the most optimal way to learn.
          </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead</h2>
          <p>
            I'm going to be honest that at the start of foundations I didn't understand why we were learning this but as I went through every sprint, it definitely has changed my outlook
            on learning and how to learning. It was especially interesting learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset. It made me want to change the idea that I won't
            ever be a computer person to I will be a computer person and I will be the best I can be. Another reason is that technology is always evolving so there's endless 
            opportunities to have career in technology which my main goal at the end of the 15 weeks.
          </p>  
        <h2>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway</h2>  
          <p>
            I answered this back in sprint 2 saying that my long term goal is to have a job as a developer working for a place that could let me be flexible with the hours I wor.
            I also thought that contracting would be possible. I'm hoping that the skills I gain here at Dev Academy could propel me into a dev team that would nurture my skills
            as a developer and work at the same time. But recently, I have been looking for possible career paths outside of coding like I was really interested in animation. I also
            have love for gaming, like the idea that I could create my own game sounds like I would really enjoy it.
          </p>
        <h2>What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp</h2>
          <p>
            Back in sprint 2 I thought that some of my biggest strengths are that I absorb information quick so that translates into being a quick learner. I can either work by myself 
            or in a team setting. During bootcamp, a big limitation for me is will be the fact that I'm very introverted. I know first hand that being introverted can affect the team 
            dynamic and put the team off. Being introverted also affects my confidence to do things. It makes me doubt myself or second guess myself and it makes me want to step
            away from roles that needs me to take leadership. Another limitation would be the fact that I'm not a computer person and could hinder me and my team in time retricted 
            challenge. But this is also a strength in a sense that I have alot of room to improve so that I can be better in the future.
          </p>
        <h2>What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be</h2>  
          <p>
            My biggest non-technical challenge at boot camp will be how calm and collected I can stay when I feel like I'm about to get frustrated and or angry. I need to tell
            myself that this is all part of the learning process as a developer. This is also crucial for myself to grow as a person. Another non technical challenge I could encounter
            at boot camp is if I'm able to adjust myself in a new environment and how quick I can do this. I can also see myself struggle to get into my groove to study.
          </p>
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA</h2>  
          <p>
            The biggest human skill I would like to develop while at boot camp is to be confident in taking on a leadership role. I feel I lack this skill and I know how this could
            affect my growth as not just a person but as well as a developer. I know I would do well in a leadership role if I had the confidence in myself to do it. Since I started
            foundations I feel that I'm more aware of myself than I have ever been so I would also like improve my self-awareness. This would also help grow as a developer and a person.
          </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>  
          <p>
            I expect myself to be at boot camp on time every day well rested, positive wanting to learn. I expect myself to better manage my time so that I'm effecient with
            my time. I know I don't like asking for help because I feel I'm annoying others but thats better than not asking and getting behind on work so I make a commitment
            to myself to ask for help when I need help and to say something when I'm getting behind. I expect myself to be healthy, to eat properly and exercise daily. By doing this I 
            will be in a ideal headspace to learn at my most optimal.
          </p>
