    <h1>Reflections</h1>
      <h2>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h2>
        <p>
            I believed that going into foundations I limited myself at how well I would learn and how capable I would be able to understand programming
            because I never really thought of myself as a computer person. I could never picture myself in a career path I.T related. But foundations has taught me that
            everyone has the ability to get better at anything they set their mind to, If they believe it themselves. I'm now confident in being able to know how
            my learning is going to go on some days based on how I feel waking up, what I ate for breakfast, how many times I've been on my phone all because im more aware
            of myself in the present. In terms of ego I was used to being the one helping others more than getting help and I didn't like to ask for help. But during foundations
             its changed the way I thought of asking for help. I used to think that I was dumb when I asked for help, now I know that its dumb for not asking. The last thing
             I noticed about myself during foundations is how easily frustrated I can get at very little unimportant things. I need to calm down and to remember that getting things wrong
             isn't a step back but a step towards progress and that this all part of the process.
        </p>

      <h2>The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h2>  
        <p>
            
        </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning</h2>  
        <p>
            The thing that most surprised me about foundations is the enormous emphasis on non-technical skills that they really want us to learn. They understand
            that to get a job and to get along with others, these skills are essential because employers are not just judging your technical capabilities, 
            but also your self-awareness, what kind of person you are, could you be a problem in a team setting and if you are flexible enough to learn while working.
            Before starting foundations I never really thought of anything other than learning technical skills But after, I now understand that things like mindfulness, 
            emotional intelligence and having a growth mindset is just as important as being proficient in technical skills.
        </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2> 
        <p>
            Coming into foundations with literally no knowledge about programming, I definitely had many challenges to overcome when learning something which was foreign to myself.
            But the biggest challenge that I personally had to deal during foundations was getting back into the whole studying groove. Even during school I was never good at studying.
            I wasn't easy either because I was working for so long that changing certain habits was especially hard. Foundations is unlike anything I'm used to but is something I'm trying to
            improve as I go along.
        </p> 
      <h2>Why do I think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course</h2>  
        <p>
            Well it isn't possible to learn absolutely everything in 15 weeks because it is really hard to learn because programming is ever evolving, it would take years.
            I believe the aim of bootcamp is that strip away everything that isn't neccesary, and teach us everything that makes us able to become programmers with the ability
            to learn more efficiently and quicker too. The non-technical skills will help us be able to better understand who work with because being able to work in a team is a good
            quality to have. It also helps us as programmers understand the most optimal way to learn.
        </p>
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead</h2>
        <p>
          I'm going to be honest that at the start of foundations I didn't understand why we were learning this but as I went through every sprint, it definitely has changed my outlook
          on learning and how to learning. It was especially interesting learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset. It made me want to change the idea that I won't
          ever be a computer person to I will be a computer person and I will be the best I can be. Another reason is that technology is always evolving so there's endless 
          opportunities to have career in technology which my main goal at the end of the 15 weeks.
