    <h1>The difference between margins, borders and padding.</h1>

  

      <h2>The Margin</h2>
        <p>
          The margin is the space around the content on a page and deals with the outermost parts of a web page.The main reason for having the margin 
          is to make sure that the content is not exposed to other objects surrounding the content all around the four sides. It ensures that the content 
          is not directly affected by the other outside objects. 
        </p>
  
      <h2>The Padding</h2>
        <p>
          The padding is the space that surrounds the content and handles the innermost parts of a page. Padding is important for content mainly because 
          it ensures that the content does not affect the borders and vice versa that the border doesn’t affect the content.
        </p>

      <h2>The Border</h2>
        <p>
          The border is the fine line between both the margin and the padding. It is needed so that they don’t affect each other. 
          The border is usually a box shape line, but can be altered into other shapes like a rectangle or an oval shape.
