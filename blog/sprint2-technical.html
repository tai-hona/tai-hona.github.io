    <h1>The difference between margins, borders and padding.</h1>

      <h2>House Analogy</h2>
       <p>
         The easiest way to understanding the difference between margins, padding and borders is to think of a house. When you build a house, you need to have
         land to build it on. One of the first things you do is put a fence around your land. Before you start building your house, you expect that there's gonna
         be some space between the fence and your house.
       </p>    

  

      <h2>The Margin</h2>
        <p>
          The margin is the space around the content on a page and deals with the outermost parts of a web page.The main reason for having the margin 
          is to make sure that the content is not exposed to other objects surrounding the content all around the four sides. It ensures that the content 
          is not directly affected by the other outside objects. When you think back to the house analogy, margin is the space between the fence and the
          house. It is part of the land but cannot affect the house or anything inside of it
        </p>
  
      <h2>The Padding</h2>
        <p>
          The padding is the space that surrounds the content and handles the innermost parts of a page. Padding is important for content mainly because 
          it ensures that the content does not affect the borders and vice versa that the border doesn’t affect the content. Again back to the house analogy
          , the content is similar to the furniture inside the house and the padding is the space around the furniture. It is around the furniture but doesn't
          neccesarily affect the furniture.
        </p>

      <h2>The Border</h2>
        <p>
          The border is the fine line between both the margin and the padding. It is needed so that they don’t affect each other. 
          The border is usually a box shape line, but can be altered into other shapes like a rectangle or an oval shape. In this sense, the border is the 
          house itself, It makes sure that anything outside(the margin) can affect the furniture(contents) or the space(the padding) around the furniture.
