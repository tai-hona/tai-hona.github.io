    <h1>Values, Strengths and Identity</h1>
    <h2>My Personal core values</h2>
    <p>Family, respect, diversity, clarity and compassion. These 5 core values are my utmost important values. These 5 values really speak in volume what kind of person they are, how they deal with problems, how they navigate through life and how they interact with others.</p>
    <h2>Cultural Influences</h2>
    <p> I really love how diverse Aotearoa(NZ) is. So because of this, I feel my personality is like I embody what NZ is. I know that anywhere in NZ there are always tightly knitted communities that reinforce that NZ is diverse. Also being Maori myself, I grew up valuing kotahitanga, which means togetherness. When one of us strives, we all strive. When one of us struggles, we all struggle. Another big influence in NZ is protecting our environment. New Zealand has some of the best scenery in the world, so we collectively try our best to look after our environment. We pride ourselves on being “tidy kiwi’s”.</p>
    <h2>Strengths and What I need to work on</h2>
    <p>My strengths are that I absorb information very quickly, I am very able when working in teams, my uniqueness to look at and solve problems and also hard working too. I really do enjoy problem-solving and learning new things all the time. I find that I can completely immerse myself in things I think are very interesting but because of this, things I don't find interesting I tend to lose focus and motivation. Time management is another thing I need to work on which is because I can be very easily distracted. I can work both leading and supporting roles on projects but can sometimes feel very controlling at times which doesn’t sit well with others a lot.</p>
    <h2>Strengths and learning path</h2>
    <p>My strengths in absorbing information quickly and being able to play both leading and supporting roles will help me greatly.The programming languages are ever evolving so my ability to quickly absorb information makes me a fast learner and makes this career path well suited to me and my strengths.</p>
    <h2>Experience working with Others</h2>
    <p>I have worked in many teams where personality clashes were a given. The only thing I could think of to try to help the situation is to put myself in their shoes and see things as they did. They would constantly argue with each other over who had the best strategy to tackle the issue at hand, but arguing never helps the situation and everyone would often get in trouble for not completing the task. Only by implementing a person in charge would things change. Because of this, there was less arguing amongst the team and we would complete our tasks. I believe that having some sort of hierarchy is the best way teams can really succeed in what they are trying to accomplish without clashes completely side tracking everything. Looking at everything from the bigger picture.</p>
