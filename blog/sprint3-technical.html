     <h1>Intro to Javascript:</h1>    
       <h2>The relationship between HTML and CSS:</h2>
          <P>
           The relationship between HTML and CSS is similar to Builder and painter. The painter doesn't have anything to paint if the builder doesn't do their job of building the house
           and the builder isn't able to make the house all nice and pretty without the painter doing their job. This isn't entirely true but like how they work better together, HTML and CSS 
           compliment each other very well.
          </P>
          <p>
           HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is like the structure of a house. It decides the layout of the web page, the images and the links inside of a web page. To decide these things in html,
           we use these things called tags. Like different rooms in a house, there are different tags. Tags for the titles of web pages, sub-headings and paragraphs etc. There is tag for everything inside html 
           CSS(Cascading style sheets) is the coding language that modifies and styles a webpage so in simple terms it makes a web pages sparkly and shiny. CSS is what decides the colour of the web page, how big the images are and where they are placed.
           CSS can also change the fonts on words and positioning of them and the images as well. This is only a small peak through the window that is html and css.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been learning html and css throughout the foundation part of the course. My understanding of html and css is that html is like the structure of a house and css like like the styling of the house, the paint, the wallpaper and what goes inside the house.
          </p>
  
       <h2>Javascript(JS):</h2>
          <p>
           Javascript is another coding language that web develpoers use. It can store data or information using variables like arrays, objects, loops and functions which works well with and talks to html and css.
           Javascript is the hardest to learn out of the three coding languages. 
          </p>
       <h3>Control flow and Loops:</h3>
          <p>
             Control flow is how code is interpreted by the computer. The control flow is usually read from top to bottom and is how the code we write is carried out. A loop is a repeated instruction or a command 
             that has told the computer to interpret the data if certain requirements are met. There are alsodifferent loops too like the for loop, while loop and the do while loop. While they're all loops, there are slight differences between them. 
             If I were to think of an analogy that control flow and loops were similar to, it would be like shopping. You have a list of things to get and 
             you have a certain way to get them. Control flow is similar to the certain way you got the items and loop is like when you forget any items and you have to go back and get them.
          </p>

       <h2>The DOM</h2>
          <p>
           The DOM is short for document object model. The DOM is the glue that puts together html and css with javascript. It is an API which stands for application programming Interface, this is an interface for web pages. 
           This is makes browsers able to interpret the code we write. Using the DOM with javascript, we can directly modify and make changes to our HTML and CSS, from the structure of our web page to re styling it too.
          </p>

        <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        
           <p>
            Arrays is a variable that we can use to store collections or a cluster of data in. We can see the contents of arrays, add and remove from the arrays. Arrays use indexing and the first element starts from 0. Objects are very similar in the fact that it also stores data too
            The key difference is that objects use properties and arrays use indexing. Properties in objects are usually defined as 'keys' and the description is called 'values'. Like arrays, You can also view and modify data inside objects too.
           </p>

        <h2>Functions:</h2>
        
          <p>
            Functions are very handy to use in Javascript. They are instructed to perform specific task and are virtually a small section of code. We can deicde the parameters of these functions. Using arguments we can call them back. We can also put loops inside a function. 
            When a function is instructed to perform a task, it will perform the task when the control flow is at the point where the function is called. The control flow then in turn, goes back to when the function is specified and then it goes from there.
