       <h1>Intro to Javascript:</h1>    


       <h2>The relationship between HTML and CSS:</h2>
       //ADD IMAGE HERE
       <P>The relationship between HTML and CSS is similar to Builder and painter. The painter doesn't have anything to paint if the builder doesn't do their job of building the house
           and the builder isn't able to make the house all nice and pretty without the painter doing their job. This isn't entirely true but like how they work better together, HTML and CSS 
           compliment each other very well.
       </P>
       <p>HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is like the structure of a house. It decides the layout of the web page, the images and the links inside of a web page. To decide these things in html,
           we use these things called tags. Like different rooms in a house, there are different tags. Tags for the titles of web pages, sub-headings and paragraphs etc. There is tag for everything inside html 
           CSS(Cascading style sheets) is the coding language that modifies and styles a webpage so in simple terms it makes a web pages sparkly and shiny. CSS is what decides the colour of the web page, how big the images are and where they are placed.
           CSS can also change the fonts on words and positioning of them and the images as well. This is only a small peak through the window that is html and css.
       </p>
       <p>I have been learning html and css throughout the foundation part of the course. My understanding of html and css is that html is like the structure of a house and css like like the styling of the house, the paint, the wallpaper and what goes inside the house.</p>
  
       <h2>Javascript(JS):</h2>
       //ADD IMAGE HERE 
       <p>Javascript is another coding language that web develpoers use. It can store data or information using variables like arrays, objects, loops and functions which works with and talks to html and css.
           Javascript is the hardest to learn out of the three coding languages. 
       </p>
       <h3>Control flow and Loops:</h3>
       <p>Control flow is how code is interpreted by the computer. The control flow is usually read from top to bottom. of course there are exceptions to this rule. A loop is an exception because it is an instruction or a command 
           that has told the computer to interpret the data if certain requirements are met. If I were to think of an analogy that control flow and loops were similar to, it would be like shopping. You have a list of things to get and 
           you have a certain way to get them. Control flow is similar to the certain way you got the items and loop is like when you forget any items and you have to go back and get them.
       </p>

       <h2>The DOM</h2>
       add image HERE
       The DOM is short for document object model. I think of the DOM like it's a tree. It all stems from the roots in the ground to the trunk ofthe tree to the branches. THe roots is like the main element
