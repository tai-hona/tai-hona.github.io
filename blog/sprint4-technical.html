      <h2>The simple problem</h2>
      <p>
         The problem that I thought was simple that I struggled with during sprint 4 was the kata: manipulating objects.
          I was about halfway through the problem and I got stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
           So my process to problem solving is to first try something, trying different variables and different values.
          When they don't work I console log and read error messages. Usually I find that the error message don't really help.
          If that doesn't work, then I try googling the problem. try different searches and looking at different links. Most of the time
          I usually find something that points me in the right direction but I didn't with this problem. Next is pseudocode and the rubber ducky method. My rubber ducky is either my phone or the mouse. 
          Pretty much anything close to me at the time. I say and do every step carefully and slowly(and loud) doing the process three or four times over and over.
          When I read out loud the steps and looked at my code, I noticed that were alot of typos and not enough brackets or the brackets aren't in the right place.
          Lastly, I ask for help from my facilitator and the slack channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the whole process, I felt quite frustrated with myself. Not knowing whether if my whole code was wrong or only a little thing was not in the right place
        or if I was missing something. But when I did find the solution, I felt this surge of relief and excitement throughout my whole body. Like all the pressure off my shoulder.
        I know that when I ask for help, alot of the time they can tell me where I went wrong, but I use this only as a last resort because I feel that I won't learn 
        properly if I keep asking for help. but also asking for help is better than not asking. I was once told by one of my previous employers is "If you have to ask a question a thousand 
        times, ask a thousand times. There is not such thing as a dumb question except a question not asked."
      </p> 
      <p>
        What I learnt from this particular problem is to read everything carefully and that every detail is very important even the little ones
        when coding and doing tests. Also not to get frustrated over little things and that all of this is part of the coding and debugging process 
        and that a dumb question is a question not asked.
      </p> 
    
    <h2>solving A Problem Elegantly</h2>
    
      <p>
        I really thought of a time during foundations where I thought I solved a problem elegantly and I have come to the conclusion that I haven't done anything Like
        that but it is a goal of mine. I have explored google to find how to solve a problem elegantly because I don't really understand how a problem can be solved elegantly.
      </p>
