      <h2>Career pathway</h2>
        <p>
          My goal long term might not be in web development but it could be. I’m leaning towards the gaming and animation side of I.T. If I were to 
          be a web developer, it would be in a place where they could train me on the job and nurture my skills as a developer. Another idea for a 
          long term goal is to have more control over my career via contracting where I could pick my clients.
        </p>

      <h2>Non-Technical Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that I’m very introverted, so a non-technical skill that I would want or to work on is to be confident in not just my work and
           skills as a developer but as a person. Time management is also another thing I need to really work on too.
        </p>

      <h2>Strengths and what to work on</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths are that I can absorb information quickly, be good at problem-solving, hard working and I can either work by myself or in a
           team. I usually get along with everyone which makes it easier to support and or lead a team. I preferably choose to play the supporting
            role rather than leading though.
        </p>
        <p>
          One area where I think I’m lacking is my confidence, Which makes me second guess everything I do and doubt my own abilities and judgement.
           I am also bad at managing my time properly too. I need to know what I’m doing and how long it should take me to do it. 
           I don’t mind working in silence but would rather listen to music to help me concentrate on what I'm doing. I also prefer to work in a
            place with dim lighting too.
        </p>

      <h2>Commitment to my work</h2>
        <p>
          I will promise myself to take breaks when I need to. When I’m stressed or frustrated, I need to take breathers and be calm and collected.
           When I have deadlines to meet I need to either use my phone or toggl to stay on top of them. I need to work in my ideal working time to
            get the maximum effort out of myself. I need to put myself in the ideal environment so that I don’t get distracted or procrastinate. 
            I also promise when I feel stuck or overwhelmed by my work, to seek help from the facilitator or talk to my cohort. If I know I am
             unable to meet deadlines, I will tell my facilitator immediately. 
        </p>
    
      <h2>Scheduling Plan</h2>
        <p>
          I have already made it aware to my facilitator that my only timely commitment is my part-time work in the afternoon. I have made the
           commitment to do my study in the morning and evening before and after my part-time work. But if i have any conflicts in the future,
            to inform my facilitator about them.
        </p>
